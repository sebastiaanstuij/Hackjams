Rebuild rxjs from scratch

- Getting started:
  - clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/hackages/hackjam.rxjs.git`
  - If you use Vanilla JS and ES6: `npm start`
  - If you use TypeScript: `npm run ts:start`
  - If you use something else then run: `npm run something`
  - First: Implement the Observable function before adding method to it

- Pair programming is mandatory :-)

- Demo: We will randomly pick a pair in the room for the demo, maybe you? :-)

If you have any questions feel free to post them here: [Gitter JavaScript Lab Dublin](https://gitter.im/javascript-lab-dublin/Lobby)

Happy Coding!
